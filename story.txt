The dark storm clouds roll across the sky as you start your journey across the Baklands. This stage of your trip will be the most testing yet. In front of you there is a road that forks in too, to the left there is a castle that appears abandoned, to the right there is an university.
for left go to 2 for right go to 3

The horseman gallop off to the north-east. A short white later, the leader stops and points out a group of carts and covered wagons, arragned in a circle, in the distance. We will take you to within walking distance of the caravan, he says, but no further. For they are armed and wary of strangers. At a trotting pace they take you within a few hundred yards of the camp. You dismount and they leave. You may now approach the caravan. Go to 137

You hold your arms up in the air and walk slowly forward. To your relief, no more arrows are released, although you can see bowmen, with shafts at the ready, covering your approach. A crowd is gathering to see who you are and you are soon close enough to make out what sort of people are watching you. You have come across a caravan of Black Elves, presumably traders of some kind. As you enter the camp, they eye you suspiciously. An old Elf, slightly stouter than the rest, steps forward. If you seek shelter or food, he starts, 'then you waste your time with this caravan. What purpose have you wandering alone through the Baklands?' What will your reply be?
Will you claim to be a trader and ask to see their wares?
Will you tell him of your mission and ask about the Seven Serpents?
Will you tell him you are after food
Turn to 315
Turn to 37
Turn to 215
and shelter and that you will pay handsomely for theirÂ hospitality?
